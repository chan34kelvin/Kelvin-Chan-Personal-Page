# Kelvin Chan's Personal Website

Visit my site: https://chan34kelvin.github.io/Personal-Site/

This award-winning portfolio website, developed with HTML, CSS, and React JS, showcases my projects, 'About Me' section, and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. It incorporates a night mode for improved readability and emphasizes clean and streamlined information by linking to my resume, GitHub, LinkedIn, and project details, without overwhelming the site.
